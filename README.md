# DIP Labs (Digital Image Processing)

**Name:** Ameya Balange  
**BT ID:** BT23ECI002

This repository contains a collection of lab experiments for Digital Image Processing (DIP). Each folder corresponds to a specific lab session, containing MATLAB/Octave scripts, input images, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lab sessions:

- **dip_lab1/**: Basic functions, image reading, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and channel extraction.
- **dip_lab2/**: Additional image processing experiments and results.

## Experiments Overview

### Lab 1: Basic Functions & Processing
- **Script**: `dip_lab1/basic_functions_processsing.m`
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Image reading and display (`imread`, `imshow`)
  - Grayscale conversion (`rgb2gray`)
  - Histogram Equalization (`histeq`)
  - Binary Thresholding
  - RGB Channel Extraction

### Lab 2: Experiment 2
- **Script**: `dip_lab2/lab2.m`
- **Resources**:
  - `lab2.pdf`: Lab report/documentation.
  - Test images (e.g., Cameraman) and result files.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amex47-web/DIP_labs.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB or Octave.
3. Navigate to the specific lab folder (e.g., `dip_lab1`).
4. Run the `.m` script file.

## Future Experiments

New labs will be added sequentially covering topics such as:
- Image Enhancement
- Filtering
- Segmentation
- Morphological Operations
