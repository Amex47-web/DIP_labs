# DIP Labs (Digital Image Processing)

This repository contains a collection of lab experiments for Digital Image Processing (DIP). Each folder corresponds to a specific lab session or topic.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lab sessions:

- **dip_lab1/**: Basic functions and image processing operations.

## Experiments

### Lab 1: Basic Functions & Processing
- **File**: `dip_lab1/basic_functions_processsing.m`
- **Description**: Introduction to basic image processing functions in MATLAB/Octave.
- **Resources**:
  - `image1.jpeg`: Sample image used for processing.
  - `pdf.pdf`: Lab documentation/report.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amex47-web/DIP_labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific lab folder (e.g., `dip_lab1`).
3. Open the `.m` scripts in MATLAB or Octave to run the experiments.

## Future Experiments

New labs will be added sequentially. Check back for updates on:
- Image Enhancement
- Filtering
- Segmentation
- And more...
